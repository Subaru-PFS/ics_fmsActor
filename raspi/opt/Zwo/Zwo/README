You MUST do two things to use the Zwo software successfully:

1. The camera will fail with the default USB input buffer size (16MB 
You MUST allocate enough memory in usb system for camera: The images
at 16-bit capture are ~37MB, so 

cat 40 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb 

There are multiple ways to do this, but I think this works. Put this
line in in
/etc/rc.local or /etc/rc.d/rc.local, as appropriate

2. Udev issue: If you wish to use the camera as a non-root user, 

make a file 

95-asicamera.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d

with content

ACTION=="add", ATTR{idVendor}=="03c3", RUN+="/bin/sh -c '/bin/echo 200 >/sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb'"
# All ASI Cameras and filter wheels
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="03c3", MODE="0666"
